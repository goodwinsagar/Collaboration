This repository contains the **frontend** codebase of a group project developed as part of a Software Development course. The project was built collaboratively by a team of five students including my self.

## About the Project

**Collaborative** is an online story board platform where users can come together to co-author documents or stories in real-time. It provides rich editing features and version tracking for collaborative writing.

## Team and Role

This project was developed by a team of 5 students. I led the project as the most experienced member of the group, guiding those with little or no prior experience through the development process.

## Note for MLH Fellowship Reviewers

This repository was created specifically for the **MLH Fellowship** to showcase our frontend work. No modifications or alterations have been made since the original submission for the course.
If required, I can also share the backend project. 



Thanks...
